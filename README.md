# CodeSwipe
a gallery for the art of code ðŸ’ž

Every day, developers around the world push billions of commits, deliberate on millions of issues, and work tirelessly to create amazing projects that transform the world around them. Unfortunately, thereâ€™s rarely an easy way for them to garner appreciation for their code. Though the apps, APIs, and libraries they create are beautiful in and of themselves, coding is an art form and deserves its own gallery.

Thatâ€™s why made CodeSwipe, the premier platform to share code snippets with other developers. Our target audience is developers of all ages looking to experience code in a new way. Users can â€˜swipeâ€™ on posts, with â€˜likedâ€™ posts showing up in their history. To create their own posts, users can paste in a code snippet, define a language, and add an (optional) description with an (optional) GitHub repository name.
